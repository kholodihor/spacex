          Find all the information you need to make a reservation online,
          everything from port size to technical specifications to licensing
          information. Once your reservation request is approved, SpaceX will
          provide you with a welcome package outlining next steps for launch.

          Payloads are received at the launch site around L-30 and processed in
          a SpaceX facility. More details can be found in the Rideshare User's
          Guide.
